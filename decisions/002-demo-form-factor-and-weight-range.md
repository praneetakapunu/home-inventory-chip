# Decision 002 — Demo form factor + per-pad/shelf weight range

- **Date:** 2026-02-22
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Owner:** Praneet

## Decision
- v1 demo form factor: **one smart shelf** (single shelf-scale system).
- **Max weight:** **1 kg** (expected maximum load on the shelf measurement).

## Rationale
A single shelf demo reduces mechanical complexity and keeps bring-up simpler while still proving end-to-end inventory-by-weight.

## Implications / follow-ups
- Use 1 kg full-scale to size load cell(s), mechanical design, and ADC gain/range planning.
- Keep acceptance resolution target per prior decision (5 g / 20 g effective) unless superseded.
- Shipping address/phone: TBD (Praneet will provide later) — becomes blocking when ordering boards/mechanics.
