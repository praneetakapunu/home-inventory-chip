# Execution Plan (v1)

This file is the actionable plan to finish ASAP. Keep it short and current.

## Current phase
**OpenMPW tapeout path lock → harness/repo integration → RTL baseline**

## Next 48 hours (Madhuri)
1) Lock tapeout path doc (`spec/tapeout-path.md`) with a concrete choice (PDK + harness + submission steps)
2) Add `docs/OPENMPW_SUBMISSION.md` and map our repo to `caravel_user_project` expectations
3) Update checklist with what’s done vs pending + turn “Risks” into tracked items
4) Start RTL baseline: define top-level + register map + ADC interface peripheral skeleton

## Blockers (must be explicit)
- None currently.

## Pending from Praneet
- None.

## Risks (watchlist)
- 5 g effective resolution may be dominated by mechanical + drift; spec must define realistic acceptance criteria.
- ADC part selection is a dependency for interface details + firmware formats.
