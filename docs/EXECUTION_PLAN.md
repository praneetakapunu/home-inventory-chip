# Execution Plan (v1)

This file is the actionable plan to finish ASAP. Keep it short and current.

## Current phase
**Spec freeze → tapeout path selection → RTL/verify/PD skeletons**

## Next 48 hours (Madhuri)
1) Write `spec/tapeout-path.md` (PDK+shuttle candidates, cost, schedule, recommendation)
2) Create repo hygiene files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, decision template
3) Stand up verification skeleton (`verify/`) with a smoke test
4) Stand up PD skeleton (`pd/`) with toolchain notes + placeholder config

## Blockers (must be explicit)
- None currently.

## Pending from Praneet
- None.

## Risks (watchlist)
- 5 g effective resolution may be dominated by mechanical + drift; spec must define realistic acceptance criteria.
- ADC part selection is a dependency for interface details + firmware formats.
