# v1 Spec — Home Inventory Chip (Pads)

## Overview
v1 is an **8-channel pad-based** inventory sensing demo. Each pad corresponds to a bin/container location. The chip is **digital-only** and reads pad measurements via an **off-chip multi-channel load-cell ADC**; the chip processes events and exposes data to a host.

## Goals
- Detect weight-change events with an effective target resolution of **~5 g** per channel (after calibration/filtering).
- Support **8 independent channels**.
- Demonstrate a practical “home inventory” flow: add/remove detection + per-bin totals.

## Non-goals (v1)
- On-chip analog front-end / ADC.
- Battery power optimization.
- RF / wireless connectivity on-chip.

## System architecture (high level)
- **Sensors:** 8 load cells (or equivalent) under 8 pads.
- **ADC:** 1 external multi-channel load-cell ADC (8ch).
- **Chip (digital):** small RISC-V SoC (or minimal MCU-class core) + peripheral bus.
- **Peripherals (chip):**
  - SPI (primary) for ADC readout (or I2C if we pick an ADC that prefers it)
  - UART for debug/bring-up
  - Optional: GPIOs for status/interrupts
  - Optional: PWM/timers for simple indicators

## Data model
Per channel (0..7):
- raw_sample (from ADC)
- calibrated_weight_g (fixed-point)
- baseline / tare
- event stream: {timestamp, delta_g, type(add/remove)}

## Calibration & filtering
- Per-channel tare/baseline capture.
- Simple digital filtering (moving average / IIR) to reduce noise.
- Event detection with hysteresis and minimum-duration qualification.

## Acceptance tests (v1)
1) **Enumerate channels:** firmware can read all 8 channels and report values.
2) **Calibration:** per-channel tare reduces static offset to within an acceptable threshold.
3) **Event detect:** step changes of ~5 g produce add/remove events reliably in controlled conditions.
4) **No crosstalk:** activity on one channel does not create false events on others beyond a defined limit.
5) **Telemetry:** host can query per-channel latest weight + event counters.

## Open questions (owned by Madhuri)
- Select the specific off-chip 8ch load-cell ADC part + interface.
- Define fixed-point formats and thresholds after ADC selection.
- Decide if host interface is UART-only or UART+SPI.
